📚 PDF Text Embedding Generator 📝

This Python package reads a PDF file, extracts the text, and generates word embeddings for each word in the text using a pre-trained Word2Vec model. The word embeddings are then saved to a JSON file.

📜 Abstract

In the field of Natural Language Processing, word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. This package automates the process of generating these word embeddings for a given PDF file. This can be useful in a variety of applications such as text summarization, document clustering, and information retrieval.

🚀 Usage

# Run the script

This script will read the PDF file specified in pdf_path, generate word embeddings for each word in the text, and save these embeddings to a JSON file.

📄 License

📦 Installation

This package requires Python 3.6 or later. To install the package, run the following command:


pip install gensim PyPDF2 tqdm


You also need to download the pre-trained Word2Vec model from here and place it in the same directory as the script.

🎉 Enjoy!
Happy embedding! 📚📝🔊
